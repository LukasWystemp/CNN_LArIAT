Feasability of CNNs for particle identification at LArIAT

This was a summer project by Lukas Wystemp at the University of Manchester in collaboration with the Fermilab Liquid argon in a testbeam (LArIAT) detector. 

The question it aimed to address was:**
- Can CNNs which have been developed for information dense photographs with various textures, colours, etc. be applied to LArTPC data which is very information sparse. Can high accuracies be achieved?
- What is the optimal model configuration and structure with the highest accuracy?
- Utilising gradient based localisation to visually represent the neural network, can I gain insights into its classification mechanisms to maximise the modelâ€™s performance, ensure applicability at LArIAT and other LArTPCs, and improve resilience to noise?
